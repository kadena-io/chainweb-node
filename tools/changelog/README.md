# CHANGELOG tools

Tools for managing the `CHANGELOG.md` file for `chainweb-node`.

## `create-entry`

Run `create-entry` in order to launch your `$EDITOR` and write a single file
into the top-level `changes/` dir. These files will be used to create changelog
entries.

## `rollup`

Automatically rolls up all entries in the `changes/` dir into a nice list,
and updates `CHANGELOG.md` for you automatically.
