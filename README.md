# Chainweb

A Proof-of-Work Parallel-Chain Architecture for Massive Throughput.
Read [our whitepaper](http://kadena.io/docs/chainweb-v15.pdf).

## Building from Source

### Building with Nix

The most reliable way to build chainweb is to use the
[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager. Once you've installed Nix, use
the command `nix-build` from the repository root to build chainweb. To do
incremental builds, run `nix-shell` and then `cabal build` or `cabal new-build`
inside the resulting shell.

### Other Build Methods

Requirements:

- Cabal >= 2.2
- GHC >= 8.4
- (optional) Stack >= 1.9

To build the various Chainweb components, run one of the following:

```
# To build with cabal
cabal install --enable-tests

# To build with stack
stack install --test
```

This will build the chainweb library, the `chainweb-node` executable, the main
test suite, and a few extra example executables.

### Running the test suite

There have been some issues with the test suite running out of file
descriptors. This may cause test suite failures.  This can be fixed by raising
ulimits as follows:

On linux add the following line to `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```
*               soft    nofile            1048576
```

On mac follow instructions [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108174/how-to-persistently-control-maximum-system-resource-consumption-on-mac).
Create the file `/Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist`.


## Running a chainweb-node

A chainweb-node has two identifiers:

*   The node-id is a permanent identifier that is used for the `miner`
    field in the header of newly mined blocks. In its current form it is a
    placeholder for an identity, e.g. a public key, that in the future will be
    provided by the pact layer. If such an identity doesn't exist or isn't
    needed, the node-id may be removed completely or kept only for debugging
    purposes. The user must provide each node with a unique node-id on startup.

*   The peer-id is used to identify the node in the peer-to-peer network. It is
    a fingerprint of an ephemeral X509 certificate that, if not provided in
    the configuration, is created automatically and  can be dropped and
    recreated at any time. Since the peer-id is used in caches and for
    reputation management, nodes are incentivised to persist and reuse peer-ids.
    When no peer-id is provided, a node generates a new peer-id on startup.

On startup a chainweb-node tries to connect to the P2P network. For that each
chainweb-node knows about a hard-coded set of bootstrap nodes. For the *Test*
chainweb-node, this is a single node with host-name `localhost`, and port
`1789`. The hard-coded certificate for the *Test* bootstrap node is defined in
the bootstrap configuration file `scripts/test-bootstrap-node.config`.

In order for a chainweb-node to be useful it must be able to connect to the
bootstrap node. The *Test* bootstrap node can be started as follows:

```sh
chainweb-node --node-id=0 --config-file=./scripts/test-bootstrap-node.config`
```

(`--interface=127.0.0.1` can be used to restrict availability of a node to the
loopback network.)

When the default bootstrap node is available additional chainweb-nodes can be
started as

```sh
chainweb-node --node-id=NID
```

where `NID` must be replaced with a unique node id.

The default `--port` value is 0 which causes the node to request a free port
from the operating system.

## Configuring a chainweb-node

Alternative or additional bootstrap nodes can be specified at startup either on
the command line or through a configuration file.

The available command line options are shown by running

```sh
chainweb-node --help
```

The configuration of a chainweb-node can be printed by appending
`--print-config` to the command line. Without any additional command line
arguments `chainweb-node --print-config` shows the default configuration.

Custom configurations can be created by generating a configuration file
with the default configuration:

```sh
chainweb-node --print-config > chainweb-node.config
```

After editing the configuration file `chainweb-node.config` the custom
configuration can be loaded with

```sh
chainweb-node --config-file=chainweb-node.config
```

The directory `scripts` contains a shell script for starting a network of
chainweb-nodes and collecting the logs from all nodes:

```sh
# create directory for log files
mkdir -p tmp/run-nodes-logs

# the first argument is the path to the chainweb-node binary
./scripts/run-nodes.sh ./chainweb-node 20 ./tmp/run-nodes-logs

# stop all nodes with Ctrl-C
```

## Chainweb Orchestration

This section describes how to not only run a chainweb node, but deploy one.

### Docker Images

#### Dependencies

- `nix >= 2.2`
- `docker >= 1.18`

The following docker images can be found on DockerHub:

* [chainweb-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/kadena/chainweb-base): Base image containing
    all of Chainweb's dependencies and executables.
* [chainweb-bootstrap-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/kadena/chainweb-bootstrap-node):
  Image that spins up a chainweb bootstrap node. Expects the node's
  configuration file to be present in `/tmp/test-bootstrap-node.config`.

Linux users can also create these images locally using Nix:

```sh
# This outputs two tar files, one for the base image and one for the bootstrap
# image. You need to be logged in to docker (`docker login`) to fetch the
# Alpine image that these two new images are based on.

$ nix-build docker.nix
$ docker load --input result
$ docker load --input result-2
```

As of at least 2019 March, it is not possible for MacOS users to build these.

### Running Kubernetes

#### Dependencies

- `kubectl >= 1.13`
  - [Mac / Windows / Ubuntu](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
  - [Arch Linux<sup>AUR</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kubectl/)
- `minikube >= 0.35`
  - [Mac / Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
  - [Arch Linux<sup>AUR</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minikube/)
- `python >= 3.7`
- `kubernetes` Python Library
  - [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/kubernetes/)
  - [Arch Linux<sup>AUR</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-kubernetes/)

#### Running Locally

1. Ensure that the above dependencies are installed.
2. Create a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube: `minikube start**
3. Load the chainweb bootstrap node:

##### Linux

For running our custom-built images. Otherwise, follow the MacOS instructions
below to run an image from DockerHub.

First, we must load our built images into *Minikube's* Docker context.

```sh
# Unnecessary if done above
$ nix-build docker.nix

# Temporarily inject Minikube-specific Docker settings in our environment.
# You can close your terminal to reset these.
$ eval `minikube docker-env`

# Load the images into Minikube's Docker context.
$ docker load --input result
$ docker load --input result-2
```

Now we can run our images:

```sh
$ python scripts/kubernetes/bootstrap_deploy.py create --image=chainweb-bootstrap-node --local
```

Excluding the `--image` and `--local` flags will cause a default image to be
pulled from Kadena's DockerHub repository.

##### MacOS

```sh
$ python scripts/kubernetes/bootstrap_deploy.py create
```

Whichever approach we chose, if creation was successful, we'll see:

```
Running with:  Namespace(func=<function create_resources at 0x7fa30aa86840>, image='chainweb-bootstrap-node:test00', local=True)
Creating cluster...
Statefule Set created. status='{'collision_count': None,
 'conditions': None,
 'current_replicas': None,
 'current_revision': None,
 'observed_generation': None,
 'ready_replicas': None,
 'replicas': 0,
 'update_revision': None,
 'updated_replicas': None}'
Done
```

4. The following commands can be used to confirm the status of the bootstrap node:

```sh
$ kubectl get pods

NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
chainweb-0   1/1     Running   0          12s
```

```sh
$ kubectl get service

NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
chainweb-0          LoadBalancer   10.105.226.234   <pending>     443:32085/TCP   6m
chainweb-headless   ClusterIP      None             <none>        1789/TCP        6m
kubernetes          ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP         3h29m
```

```sh
$ minikube service chainweb-0 --url

http://192.168.99.100:32085
```

```sh
$ curl https://192.168.99.100:32085/swagger.json -v -k

# A wall of JSON output.
```

```sh
$ watch -n 1 "kubectl logs chainweb-0 | tail -n 25"

# An auto-updating feed of log messages. You should see blocks being mined.
```

5. To clean up these resources, run `python scripts/kubernetes/boostrap_deploy.py delete`.

#### Running on AWS

*Pending.*

<!-- 3. For instructions on how to interact with Kubernetes, follow these -->
<!--    [examples](http://kubernetesbyexample.com/). Note that they are using a -->
<!--    Minishift local cluster instead of a Minikube one. -->

<!-- [K8S cluster on AWS](https://medium.com/containermind/how-to-create-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-in-few-minutes-89dda10354f4). -->

<!-- NB: 03/06/2019 To run the cluster with your local docker images, follow the -->
<!-- instructions -->
<!-- [here](https://blogmilind.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/running-local-docker-images-in-kubernetes/). -->
<!-- The script `scripts/dev_startup.sh` automates some of these steps already for -->
<!-- minikube clusters. This method will not work for cloud-based clusters. -->

#### Connecting to a Bootstrap Node

The `chainweb-node` binary has a built-in list of official bootstrap nodes, but
we can specify others on the command line. For a locally running bootstrap, we
first confirm the IP and port:

```sh
$ minikube service chainweb-0 --url

http://192.168.99.100:32742
```

Now we run a `chainweb-node` as usual, except that we add the `--peer-info`
flag:

```sh
$ chainweb-node --node-id=<SOME-ID> --peer-info=9LkpIG95q5cs0YJg0d-xdR2YLeW_puv1PjS2kEfmEuQ@192.168.99.100:32742

# A wall of log messages.
```

`9LkpIG95q5cs0YJg0d-xdR2YLeW_puv1PjS2kEfmEuQ` is the certificate fingerprint of
the built-in test certificate. This may differ from your situation, but the true
fingerprint can always be found in your `chainweb-node`'s log messages.

Connecting to an official bootstrap node is even simpler:

```sh
$ chainweb-node --node-id=<SOME-ID> --peer-info=us1.chainweb.com:443

# A wall of log messages.
```

## Component Structure

The production components are:

*   `chainweb` library: It provides the implementation for the different
    components of a chainweb-node.

*   `chainweb-node`: An application that runs a Chainweb node. It maintains copies
    of a number of chains from a given Chainweb instance. It provides interfaces
    (command-line and RPC) for directly interacting with the chainweb or for
    implementing applications such as miners and transaction management tools.

*   `chainweb-tests`: A test suite for the chainweb library and chainweb-node.

In addition, the following example executables are included which demonstrate
the use of individual sub-components:

*   `single-chain-example`: An simple end-to-end scenario for mining
    and synchronizing nodes for a single chain.

*   `blockheaderdb-example`: Example for how to use the BlockHeaderDB API of chainweb.

*   `p2p-example`: A simple p2p network implementation.
