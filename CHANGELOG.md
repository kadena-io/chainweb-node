# `chainweb-node` Changelog

## 1.8 (2020-04-27)

This version replaces all previous versions. Any prior version will stop working
on **2020-04-30T00:00:00Z**. Node administrators must upgrade to this version
before that date.

This version will stop working on **2020-06-11T00:00:00Z**.

*   Starting with block height 530500 the first eight bytes of each block must be
    set to zero. (#974)

*   The option to persist the peer database is removed. The functionality
    was rarely used and can be simulated by using the peer REST API endpoints
    along with the know peers configuration option. (#1010)

*   Removed the PUT endpoints from the `/chain/header` APIs. (#1002).

*   Make block header validation aware of adjacent parents. (#1004).

*   Increased the default block gas limit by 10x to 150,000. Note that if you
    have manually specified a block gas limit in your node config file, this
    change will not take effect. We recommend removing it and using the
    chainweb-node default. (#1019).

## 1.7 (2020-03-26)

This version replaces all previous versions. Any prior version will stop working
on **2020-04-02T00:00:00Z**. Node administrators must upgrade to this version
before that date.

This version will stop working on **2020-04-30T00:00:00Z**.

The use of the first eight bytes of the mining jobs bytes as nonce is now
considered deprecated. Those bytes should be set to 0x0. Only the last eight
bytes must be used as nonce.  Miners and pools should start upgrading to the new
behavior. The new behavior will be enforced in a future version.

* Compute epoch time based on parent header. This change won't affect any
  any users of Chainweb. The change will become effective at block height
  452820. (#977)

* Validate transaction creation time and expiration with respect to creation
  of the parent block header. This change brings the checks for transaction
  validity in line with the time used during Pact validation. (#935, #942)

  There is a 90 second leniency applied for transactions to become valid. This
  change will become effective at chain block height 449940. In the time before
  the change becomes active users may experience that new nodes reject their
  transactions. This can be mitigated by using a negative offset for the
  creation of about 2 minutes. (#973)

* A new flag `--allowReadsInLocal` and configuration option was added that
  enables direct database reads of smart contract tables in local queries.
  (#938)

* Fixed a rare bug that could affect nodes during history rewinds. (#940)

* Internal CPU mining use the last eight bytes of the mining jobs bytes as nonce
  (#957)

* Add missing `cut` API to the swagger documentation of the Chainweb API (#980)

* Fixes a bug that caused Chainweb nodes to crash during startup due to running
  out of RAM. (#982)

* Beside several stability and performance improvements this release
  also greatly improves test coverage and the quality of the code base to
  support long term maintainability of the Chainweb codebase.

## 1.3 (2019-12-08)

CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE [2 of 3]: addressing vulnerability #797.
All node operators need to update no later than 2019-12-10T20:00:00.

* [SECURITY] Address vulnerability 797 via precompiled statements [#798]

```
Must now be:

```yaml
      miners:
      - account: foobar
        predicate: keys-all
        public-keys:
        - 3438e5bcfd086c5eeee1a2f227b7624df889773e00bd623babf5fc72c8f9aa63
      - account: cfd7816f15bd9413e5163308e18bf1b13925f3182aeac9b30ed303e8571ce997
        predicate: keys-all
        public-keys:
        - cfd7816f15bd9413e5163308e18bf1b13925f3182aeac9b30ed303e8571ce997
```

## 1.2 (2019-12-04)

## 1.1 (2019-12-02)

This is a major release that activates coin transfers on December 5 2019 16:00 UTC.
All node operators should upgrade ASAP.
1.0.x nodes will stop mining and fail to launch after December 5 2019 00:00 UTC.

* Improve logging for orphan blocks. [#752]

* Finalize gas model. [#744]

* Updates to staged transaction rollout behavior. Coin transactions will be
  enabled on December 5, and the ability to deploy smart contracts will be
  enabled on January 15. [#743,#755,#759,#769]

* Improve cut DB membership queries. [#756]

* Better error handling for /mining/solved endpoint. [#762]

* Increase mempool session timeout. [#761]

## 1.0.6 (2019-11-26)

This is a minor release that provides stability and performance improvements. It also
upgrades the testnet version.

Miners are advised to also upgrade to the most recent version of the mining
application. Older versions of `chainweb-miner` may experience occasional delays
of work update notifications when used with this `chainweb-node` version.

* Improves the stability of Chainweb nodes, by closing a TCP connection leak on
  nodes that had mining coordination enabled.
  [#735]

* Improve performance of Chainweb nodes, by changing the default memory
  allocation parameters of the Haskell runtime. The default, built in RTS
  settings are now `+RTS -N -A64M -H1G`.
  [#737]

* Upgrade the testnet version from `testnet02` to `testnet03`.
 [#736]


## 1.0.5 (2019-11-21)

This version changes the rules for Difficulty Adjustment in scenarios where
there is a sudden loss of over 99% of the network hash power. While this is very
unlikely to happen, this altered logic could result in a fork if not applied by
the majority of the network. **Node administrators are advised to upgrade to
this version as soon as possible.**

### Significant Changes

- Emergency difficulty adjustment is disabled from chain height 80,000 onward.
  This is technically a fork, although it will hopefully never become relevant.
  [#671]

### Configuration Changes

- Configuration options for logging blocks to Amberdata was removed.
  [#717]

### Bug Fixes

- Parsing of the configuration file properties `p2p.peer.certificateChainFile`
  and `p2p.peer.keyFile` was fixed.
  [#703]

## 1.0.4 (2019-11-13)

#### Improved Mining Configuration

Mining configuration has been consolidated into a single section:

```yaml
mining:
  coordination:
    enabled: false
    mode: private
    limit: 1200
    miners: []
```

Please update your config to the [new minimal configuration file](./minimal-config.yaml).

If you compare to the old config, you will notice that the `miningCoordination`
field has been moved.

#### Private Mining

When `enabled: true` and `mode: private`, you must provide a list of account
names into the `miners` field. Only remote clients that declare they are mining
to these blessed accounts will be able to receive work - all others will be
rejected. You can use this to protect your node from unwanted visitors.

#### Configurable Work Request Limits

The `limit` field can be set to restrict the number of mining work requests that
occur over a 5 minute period. Requests over this limit are rejected with a `503`
error code.
