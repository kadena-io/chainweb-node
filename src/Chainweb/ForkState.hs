module Chainweb.ForkState
(
) where

-- | Starting with Chainweb 2.33, forks are identified by a monotonically
-- increasing fork number. Each block is created according to a specific fork
-- number.
--
-- Each fork number is associated with a specific block height at which it
-- becomes active. This number is also called the "fork height" for the
-- respective fork. Forks are either activated on a per chain or a per network
-- basis. The former are triggered as soon as the specific chain reaches the
-- block height for the respective fork. The latter are triggered when all
-- chains in the network have reached the respective block height.
--
-- The Fork height of a fork is determined by miners, usually via upgrading to
-- a new software version that includes the fork activation logic, but it is
-- also possible that a new software version allows miners to configure whether
-- they want to support a specific fork or not.
--
-- For the purpose of fork activation the feature flags field in the block
-- header is renamed into the "fork state" field.
--
-- The support for a fork by a miner is signaled by increasing the vote count
-- for the fork in a newly mined block by one. Votes are accumulated over
-- 120 epochs (5 days), which is called a "fork epoch". I.e. a fork epoch
-- consists of 12 * 120 block heights.
--
-- A fork is activated in an epoch when at least 2/3 of all blocks for the
-- previous 120 epochs have signaled for the respective fork number. Once a fork
-- is activated it can not be deactivated again. The fork number is
-- monontonically increasing.
--
-- A block that is signalling a fork number that is larger than the current fork
-- number plus one is considered invalid. In other words forks can only be
-- activated successively, one at a time. There will always be at least 120
-- epochs between the activation of two successive forks.
--
-- Starting with chainweb-node version 2.33, a node must accept blocks that have
-- either the fork number of the block height of the block or the respetive fork
-- number plus one. It must reject all other blocks. The fork number at the time
-- that chainweb node version 2.33 is released is zero.
