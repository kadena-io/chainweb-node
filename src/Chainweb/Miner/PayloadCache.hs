-- Module: Chainweb.Miner.PayloadCache
-- Copyright: Copyright Â© 2024 Kadena LLC.
-- License: MIT
-- Maintainer: Lars Kuhtz <lars@kadena.io>
-- Stability: experimental
--
-- As payload providers propose new payloads for the latest blocks those are
-- cached by the miner.
--
-- NOTE that consensus (and not the mining coordinator or payload provider)
-- decides when it makes sense to produce payloads on top of a block. It does so
-- by notifying the payload provider in a syncToBlock call. This way block
-- production and mining can be supressed, for instance, during catchup or deep
-- catch merges.
--
-- Because payloads do not depend on parents on adjacent chains, it always makes
-- sense to compute and cache new payloads because even as chains are still
-- blocked payloads can already be computed.
--
-- The mining coordinator will request payloads for parent headers as chains
-- become unblocked.
--
-- The cache will always provide the most recent payload for a given parent
-- header. However, because mining is asynchronous, it is possible that a miner
-- resolves a block for a non-recent parent header. Hence, all payloads for a
-- given parent header must be kept.
--
-- Payloads can only be deleted when a parent header becomes outdated. Because
-- in Chainweb branches grow non-monotonically, there is no well-defined moment
-- when a payload becomes definitely outdated. However, usually, one or two
-- block heights should be sufficient. The diameter of the graph is a safe
-- choice. For any deeper reorgs payloads would have to be recomputed. Also, we
-- do not expect miners still working on older payloads anyways, so no miner
-- work would be lost.

-- | A new payload cache for a chain.
--
-- Payloads are pruned from this cache when a new payload is received that is
-- more than graph diameter block heights ahead. Only items that have a block
-- height that is smaller than most recent item are guaranteed to be cached.
-- Items with larger block height may or may not be  pruned.
--
-- TODO: we should probably also limit the size, either globally or per block
-- height.
--
-- TODO: This could be implemented more efficiently by using a ring buffer with
-- one map per block height. The buffer size would have to change when the graph
-- changes. However, graph changes are rare events and it is fine to always use
-- the largest graph defined by a fork point, even if the graph transition has
-- not yet occurred.
