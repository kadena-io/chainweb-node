-- Module: Chainweb.Cut.Create
-- Copyright: Copyright Â© 2020 Kadena LLC.
-- License: MIT
-- Maintainer: Lars Kuhtz <lars@kadena.io>
-- Stability: experimental
--
-- The steps for extending a Cut with a new Block are usually as follows:
--
-- 1. Select a chain for the new Block header
-- 2. Call 'getCutExtension'. If the result is 'Nothing' the chain is
--    blocked. In which case another chain must be choosen.
-- 3. Call pact service to create new payload for the new block
-- 4. Assemble preliminary work header, with preliminary time and nonce value
--    (time should be current time, nonce should be 0) and send work header
--    to the miner.
-- 5. Receive resolved header (with final nonce and creation time) from miner
-- 6. Create new header by computing the merkle hash for the resolved header
-- 7. Extend cut with new header by calling 'tryMonotonicCutExtension'
-- 8. Create new cut hashes with the new header and payload attached.
-- 9. Submit cut hashes (along with attached new header and payload) to cut
--    validation pipeline.

-- 1. The parent header is in the cut.

-- | Witness that a cut can be extended for the given chain by trying to

--
-- complexity: O(degree(Graph))
--
-- Generally, adajacent validation uses the graph of the parent header. This
-- ensures that during a graph transition the current header and all
-- dependencies use the same graph and the inductive validation step works
-- without special cases. Genesis headers don't require validation, because they
-- are hard-coded. Only in the first step after the transition, the dependencies
-- have a different graph. But at this point all dependencies exist.
--
-- A transition cut is a cut where the graph of minimum height header is
-- different than the graph of the header of maximum height. If this is a
-- transition cut, i.e. the cut contains block headers with different graphs, we
-- wait until all chains transitions to the new graph before add the genesis
-- blocks for the new chains and move ahead. So steps in the new graph are not
-- allowed.
--
-- TODO: it is important that the semantics of this function corresponds to the
-- respective validation in the module "Chainweb.Cut", in particular
-- 'isMonotonicCutExtension'. It must not happen, that a cut passes validation
-- that can't be further extended.
