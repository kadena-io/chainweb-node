-- 1. Submit initial ForkInfo
-- 2. If result is not as requested: let ph be the height of the payload provider state.
-- 3. Efficiently compute fork point (starting at min of ph and target height)
-- 4. Get chunk size prefix of branch from fork point to target block
-- 5. Submit new ForkInfo with that prefix
-- 6. If result height is smaller than fork point retry from start and eventually fail.
-- 7. If result is on prefix continue with next prefix chunk from result.
-- 8. If result is larger than fork point and not on branch compute new fork
--    point. If that forkpoint is on prefix continue with next prefix chunk form
--    forkpoint. Otherwise retry from start and eventually fail.

-- We do not include a new block context for chunked forkinfo resolutions.
-- Mining should be performed only on a fully caught up payload provider.
