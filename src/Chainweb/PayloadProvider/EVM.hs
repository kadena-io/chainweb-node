-- The EVM EL has to perform the following Chainweb specific validation tasks
-- on each EL header:
--
-- 1. The miner reward in coinbase is correct
-- 2. The payload hash is the Merkle root of the EL header.
-- 3. EL time = CL parent time
--
-- TODO:
-- * is the third point really necessary?
-- * How is the expected payload hash determined?

data EvmPayloadProvider = EvmPayloadProvider
    { _evmState :: !SyncState
        -- ^ The current sync state of the EVM EL.
    }

-- | Synchronize the EL to the given block.
--
-- We *must* validate that the EL header is valid.
--
-- To evaluate the EL header it can be queried from the EL. Or the CL can store
-- the EL headers in the payload database and provide them to the EL. In that
-- case the the EL would be obligated to validate all headers that are provided.

        -- the CL state on individual chains. In practice, this means that
        -- reorgs are applied lazily and may be delayed on individual chains.

            -- If the validation fails, we set the sync state to the last

            -- from the EVM. If the sync was successful, we need a way to
            -- "reset" the EVM EL to the actual sync state. This is not possible
            -- through the engine API.
            -- An alterative is to require that users trust the lastest EVM
            -- block only if it is in a CL cut, which is not practical.
            -- Another option would be to disable the EVM API altogether until
            -- the EVM is in sync again. It is not clear how this could be
