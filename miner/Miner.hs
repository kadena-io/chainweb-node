-- The fast "inner loop" of the mining process. Sits idle upon startup until
-- work is submitted.
--
-- == Purpose and Expectations ==
--
-- This tool is a low-level, push-based, private, multicore CPU miner for
-- Chainweb. By this we mean:
--
--   * low-level: the miner is aware of what how `BlockHeader`s are encoded into
--     `ByteString`s, as indicated by an external spec. It does not know how to
--     construct a full `BlockHeader` type, nor does it need to. It has no
--     concept of `Cut`s or the cut network used by Chainweb - it simply
--     attempts `Nonce`s until a suitable hash is found that matches the current
--     `HashTarget`.
--
--   * push-based: Work is submitted to the miner in the form of an encoded
--     candidate `BlockHeader`. The miner then automatically handles cancelling
--     previous mining attempts, hashing, cycling the `Nonce`, and caching the
--     result. Note that we maintain no "long connections", so work submissions
--     yield an HTTP response immediately, and the results of successful mining
--     must be polled manually.
--
--   * private: Work can be submitted (and results polled) by anyone. It is
--     therefore expected that a miner's HTTP interface is not exposed to the
--     open internet.
--     __It is the duty of the user (you) to ensure a correct configuration!__
--
--   * multicore: the miner uses 1 CPU core by default, but can use as many as
--     you indicate. GPU support will be added soon.
--
-- Since this miner is "low-level", it is up to the user to submit valid encoded
-- `WorkBytes` - an encoded `HashTarget` + `BlockHeader` combination - derived
-- from some suitable `Cut` (a full @chainweb-node@ handles this automatically).
--
-- When mining has completed for some given work, the process will sit idle. At
-- most, between 128 and 256 recently mined `HeaderBytes`s per chain will be
-- kept in the cache. If the miner process exits, the cache is lost.
-- __Unpolled results thus cannot be recovered after a miner has been shutdown.__
--
-- == Usage ==
--
-- === submit/ endpoint ===
--
-- A POST call, expecting a `WorkBytes` in the @octet-stream@ content type. This
-- will cancel any current mining. If you wish to mine on multiple chains
-- simultaneously, you can run multiple miner processes on different ports.
--
-- === poll/ endpoint ===
--
-- A GET call, given a `ChainId` and `BlockHeight` where we expect there to be a
-- result. /May/ return a single `HeaderBytes`, if mining were successful there.
-- Failure is represented by an empty `ByteString` and indicates one of the
-- following:
--
--   * New work cancelled the previous, thus no result was saved.
--   * Mining may still succeed before the work stales, but just hasn't yet.
--   * The given `ChainId` and `BlockHeight` were incorrect.
